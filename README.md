## How to run

First of all, traditionally run `npm i` to install node modules.
Also you have to make sure you have json-server installed on your machine, if not, run `npm i json-server`.
Okay now we are ready to run the app:

1. open terminal and run `json-server db.json` to run the json-server
2. open new terminal and run `ng serve` to run the app.

### That's it, congratulations!
