            This application is a part of the IT Academy STEP Angular course. It is designed to demonstrate the basic
            concepts of Angular, such as components, services, routing, and forms. The application is built with Angular
            Material, a UI component library that provides a set of high-quality components for building responsive and
            accessible web applications.

            The application consists of three main components: the User List, the User Profile, and the User Edit. The
            User
            List component displays a list of users with their names, emails, and roles. The User Profile component
            displays
            the details of a selected user, including their name, email, and role. The User Edit component allows the
            user to
            edit the details of a selected user, including their name, email, and role.

            This dashboard offers a modern and efficient user interface. It features a simple and clean design aimed at
            providing a user-friendly experience. The emphasis is on simplicity and clarity, with a minimalist approach
            to design elements. This ensures ease of use and reduces cognitive load for users interacting with the
            application. The code is written with best practices using RxJS superpowers for state management and data
            streaming through the application. Streams are well controlled / optimized and not overused, thanks to RxJS
            operators.
